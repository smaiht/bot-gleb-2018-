# VK Group Chat Bot ü§ñ

Welcome to my first repository! This bot is designed for VK group chats and comes packed with a variety of features to enhance the group chat experience.

## Features üåü

- **Meme Generation**: 
  Generate memes using specified templates and text. 
  *Example*: `!–¥—Ä–µ–π–∫@—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å –∫ –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–π –ø–∞—Ä–µ@—Å–ø–∞—Ç—å –¥–æ 12`

- **Personal Schedule Retrieval**: 
  Fetch personal schedules for a specific day or week. The bot identifies the user's academic group based on their first and last name.
  *Examples*: `—Ä–∞—Å–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è`, `—Ä–∞—Å–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ –∑–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞`, `—Ä–∞—Å–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –°–ú8-32`, `—Ä–∞—Å–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ –ø—è—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü—É`, etc.

- **Faculty Information**: 
  Retrieve full name, email, or phone number of a faculty member upon request.
  *Examples*: `–ö–∞–∫ –∑–æ–≤—É—Ç –ò–≥—Ä–∏—Ü–∫–æ–≥–æ?`, `–ö–∞–∫–∞—è –ø–æ—á—Ç–∞ —É –ú–∞—Ç–≤–µ–µ–≤–æ–π?`, etc.

- **Idiot of the Day**: 
  Once a day, determine the "idiot of the day" among all chat participants and maintain a leaderboard.
  *Command*: `!–∫—Ç–æ`

- **Birthday Wishes**: 
  Automatically sends birthday wishes to chat participants on their special day.

- **Keyword-based Memes**: 
  Send meme images based on specific keywords.
  *Examples*: `–±—É–Ω–¥`, `–Ω–µ—Ñ—Ç—å`, etc.

- **Random Content**: 
  Fetch random jokes, greetings, or memes from external sources.

## ü§ØAnd the most fun feature:
- Whenever someone in the chat writes "–¥–∞", the bot responds with "–ü–ò–ó–î–ê".
